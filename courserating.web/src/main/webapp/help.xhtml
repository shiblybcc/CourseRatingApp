				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>This website is intended to help new students as well as existing students to 
				select their courses. In RWTH University students from different countries come to study. 
				Most cases the study system is not similar with their home country. Keeping that in mind 
				we developed this website to help those students. 
				</p>
				<h3>How it works</h3>
				<p> 
				Students who take a course in a semester can rate a lecture in different category like whether 
				the professor was good at his lecture or not, whether the exercises was easy or not etc. 
				Students can also write their review as comment for the course. And at last other users can 
				up vote or down vote the comments which explains whether the comment was useful or not. 
				</p>
				
				<p> So if any student is confused with so many courses and which one to choose from them,
				can visit our website and have a look at the courses that are easy, useful and popular to 
				other students. </p>
